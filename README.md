NOTE:

Due to an unforeseen consequence of a careless hardware change, digit 4 ~ 9 will be turned off while pressing button 1. (PC0)

To minimize the impact of the flaw, button 1 is used as the Alarm key, while button 2 (PB0) is used as Up, and button 3 (PB1)
is used as the Down key. 

Note that the (Korean) silkscreen on the PCB still denotes button 1 as the Up, button 2 as the Down, and button 3 as the Alarm key.
